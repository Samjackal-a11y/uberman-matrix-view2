# Uberman Matrix View v3.4

This is the glyph engine of the Uberman Blueprint — a modular, ethical operating system for whole-person learning.

## 🔹 What It Does
- Renders Matrix-style glyph rain from blueprint JSON
- Emotion modulates glyph color (warmth)
- Curiosity modulates glyph speed (exploration)
- Loop structure mirrors cognitive rhythm: Setup → Update → Render → Loop

## 🔹 Fuel for Thought
Dopamine anchors curiosity at the top of the loop. Glyphs act as triggers. The system breathes.
